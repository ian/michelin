The Michelin Guide for the Benelux region, encompassing Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, was first published in 1957. This edition marked the beginning of consistent annual publications for the region. Prior to this, Belgium had its own guide starting in 1904, but the combined Benelux guide was introduced in 1957.
